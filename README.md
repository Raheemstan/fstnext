This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project that I am using to learn web development. It was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To explore and experiment with this project, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Once the server is running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

Feel free to modify `app/page.tsx` to see how changes are reflected instantly in the browser.

This project also demonstrates the use of ShadCN, Authjs,sanity and many other tools and techniques.

## Deploy on Vercel

As part of my learning journey, I plan to deploy this project using the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme), which is the recommended deployment solution for Next.js applications.

For more details on deployment, refer to the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying).
